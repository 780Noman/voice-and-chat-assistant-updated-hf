## ‚ú® Features

- **Dual-Mode Interaction:** Switch between a traditional text-based chat and a hands-free voice conversation.
- **Bilingual Support:** Fluent in both Urdu and English. The assistant recognizes the language and responds accordingly.
- **Real-Time Speech-to-Text:** Utilizes Google's speech recognition engine to accurately transcribe your voice commands.
- **Natural Text-to-Speech:** Generates clear and natural-sounding voice responses using Google's Text-to-Speech (gTTS) service.
- **Powered by Gemini:** Leverages the speed and power of the `gemini-1.5-flash` model for intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Secure API Key Handling:** Your Gemini API key is managed securely within the session and is not exposed.
- **Easy to Deploy:** Includes configuration files for straightforward deployment on platforms like Hugging Face Spaces.

## üöÄ How It Works

The application follows a simple yet powerful workflow:

1.  **Input:** The user provides a Gemini API key and then either types a message or records audio using the microphone.
2.  **Processing (Voice Mode):**
    *   The recorded audio is sent to the `SpeechRecognition` library.
    *   The library transcribes the audio into text, specifically configured for Urdu (`ur-PK`).
3.  **AI Generation:**
    *   The user's text prompt (either typed or transcribed) is sent to the Google Gemini API along with the conversation history.
    *   The Gemini model generates a relevant and contextual response.
4.  **Output:**
    *   **Text Mode:** The response is displayed directly in the chat window.
    *   **Voice Mode:** The `langdetect` library identifies the language of the response. The text is then converted into an audio file using `gTTS`, which is played back automatically to the user.
